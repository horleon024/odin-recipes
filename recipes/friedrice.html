<p>This is my revised version of another pork fried rice recipe. I often substitute chicken for pork, and it doesn't change anything. I have used both basmati rice and long-grain rice which gives the dish only a slight flavor difference. I have also added celery in the past with good outcomes. Enjoy.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
	<li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
	<li>1 boneless pork loin chop</li>
	<li>1/4 cup chopped carrot</li>

	<li>1/8 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
